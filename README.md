#VMVM - Unit Test Virtualization for Java
==========
**VMVM** is a system for isolating unit tests with very low overhead.

This repository contains the source and a [runnable binary](https://github.com/Programming-Systems-Lab/xxxxFIXME) for **VMVM**.

###For more information
Please refer to our [Technical Report](http://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=1549) or email [Jonathan Bell](mailto:jbell@cs.columbia.edu)

Running
-----
### Instrumenting your code
Execute the instrumenter. Make sure that the asm library and the vmvm library are both in your classpath, then run the Instrumenter class with two arguments. The first argument is the folder containing the project to instrument. The second argument is the destination for the instrumented version.
Example:
`java -cp lib/asm-all-4.1.jar:vmvm.jar edu.columbia.cs.psl.vmvm.Instrumenter folder-to-instrument folder-dest`


### Modifying your build scripts


In case of problems..
